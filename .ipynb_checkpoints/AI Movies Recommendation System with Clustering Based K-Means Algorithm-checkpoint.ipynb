We'll recommend movies to users which are more relevant to them based on their previeous history. We'll only import those data, where users has rated movies 4+ as we want to recommend only those movies which users like most. In this whole article, we have used Python programming language with their associated liabraries i.e. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. Moreover, we have supposed that the reader has familiarity with Python and the aforementioned liabraries."

    "In this busy life as people don't have time to search for their desired item and even they want it on their table or even in a little effort. So, the recommendation system has become an important part to help them to make a right choice for their desired thing and to grow our product. Since data is increasing day by day and in this era with such a large database, it has even become a difficult task to find a more relevant item of our interest, because often we can't search an item of our interest with just a title and even sometime it is harder. So, recommendation system help us to provide a most relevant item to individual available in our database. \n",

    "In this article, we'll build a movies recommendation system. Movies recommendation system has become an essential part to movies website because an individual don't know which movies are more interested to him with just a title or genre. Sometime an individual likes action movies but he/she will not always like every action movie. To handle this problem, many authors has provided a better way to recommend a movie to user 1 from the watchlist or favourit movies of another user 2 whose movies database is more relevant to the user 1. That is, if the tast of two people is same, then both of them will like each other favourit food. Many tech giants has been using these recommendation system in their applications like YouTube, Netflix, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, machine learning (ML) models has helped us a lot to build such recommendation system based on users previous watch history. ML models learns from users watch history and categorize them into groups which contain users of same taste. Different types of ML models has been used like clustering algorithms, deep learning models etc."

If we take a look at data, then we can observe that this data can be divided into three groups. In this plot which is only designed for intuition, a common man can observe that we can divide into three groups. But some times we have very complex and big data or some time we have 3-dimensional or 4-dimensional or more generally we can have 100 dimensions or 1000 or even more than this. Then, it is not possible for human to categorize such type of data and even we can't plot such a higher dimensional data. Also, sometimes we don't know theoptimal number of clusters we should have for our data. So, we use some clustering algorithms which can work for such big data which can even of thousands of dimensions and their are methods which can be used to know the optimal of clusters.\n",

Further, as we can see its look like an elbow, the joint elbow will be the optimal number of clusters which is in this case is $5$.
